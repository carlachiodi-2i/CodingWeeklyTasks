# Challenge 4
 ### Create a game in any language/app/platform, however, make it as frustrating and painful to complete as possible!

 This is a super slow Tetris games made with JavaScript.
 Use the arrow keys to move or rotate the tetrominos. The move down is super fast which makes it almost impossible to use at higher levels.

 Every completed row gives you 12 points.\
 Every hundred points you increase a level. The speed will increase.\
 Get at least 700 points to win the game!

 #### Let the ~~frustration~~ game begins! :)
